            <h2>About</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                    I am an audio engineer, lover of all things music and sound, and an athlete. My current
                    goal is to become a software engineer. I hope to harness my creativity to create products and techonlogies that
                    improve people's lives and make me proud of myself. I am currrently attending Coding Temple, a tech bootcamp 
                    that is giving me the tools to begin my journey in the tech landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    At 16, I left high school to take community college classes. I then decided to pursue a trade school diploma for audio engineering.
                    Attending the Conservatory of Recording Arts & Sciences was an amazing experience that gave me a wide range of skills related to 
                    live, studio, film, broadcast, and game sound as well as acoustics. I spent the next 6 years in studios, live sound venues, 
                    corporate settings, and even a nonprofit organization gaining experience and applying my audio skills. 
                    Here is a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1Wxh3QbQItRHpEwIbr4ZXp?si=acf981c36a374b8e" target="_blank">link</a> to one of
                    the songs I worked on. I recorded, mixed, mastered, co-produced and co-wrote this one. Also, <a href="https://github.com/ceubie">here</a> is a link to my github!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    During my time working as a professional audio engineer, I found it difficult to find the work that I wanted, and maintain a consistent
                    work schedule. This made it difficult to have a work-life balance and provide for myself. After some family medical emergencies this past
                    year, I made the decision to switch career paths so I could give myself a better life and provide for my family. I am excited to become
                    part of an industry where there is so much to learn, and so many possibilities. I already find myself thinking about some potential projects
                    that could incorporate what I am learning at Coding Temple, with my background in sound and music. I think there are many applications for
                    my specific skill set, and I strongly believe there is a niche that I can fill in this diverse tech landscape.

            <h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I am in the process of doing some research that will allow me to get started on a personal project I find very interesting. While
                on vacation recently, it was getting dark and I had the privilege of watching some bats fly around. I took note of the fact that they
                fly in a seemingly very chaotic manner, and remembered that they use ultrasonic echolocation to navigate in the dark and detect their surroundings. 
                This chaotic flight behavior is actually indicative of their extreme agility and amazing sensory capabilities. With my understanding of sound, 
                and newly gained backend skills, I started to think about creating something that could mimic this ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first phase of my project will involve sound localization. I would like to train an AI equipped with a microphone array
                by emitting sounds from speakers that are surrounding the mics. After succesfully being able to identify direction and approximate distance,
                I would like to create a new iteration of the robot that incorporates 5 ultrasonic speakers and microphones. The robot will emit high 
                frequency (30kHz-250kHz) bursts that are followed by silent intervals to analyze the reflections. The burst/silence interval will 
                likely be dynamic, and dependenton the distance from an object and it's speed. These bursts and silences in bats tend to be anywhere 
                from 5-10 miliseconds, to 100 milliseconds. This is extremely fast, and leads me to think about the amazing processing speed of the auditory 
                system in bats. Not only is the speed impressive, but they are also so accurate in analyzing the reflections of the high frequency sounds they produce,
                that they can identify something as small as human hair. AI echolocation is an incredibly fascinating prospect. The applications are immense.
                This could allow a robot to, "see," around corners and be a failsafe for computer vision if a robot's vision is lost. By using frequencies
                in the megahertz range, a robot could also potentially see through objects or containers, and know the contents of them - something akin
                to x-ray vision.
